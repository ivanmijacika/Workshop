Summary:

Q0: If you remove render_template I think it will no longer be able to use templates, such as the model_tmplt in the templates folder.

Q1: We can use the address from before "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" but with "my_foist_template" added on to the end

Q2:'model_tmplt.html' is the template being used, 'collection=coll' determines that the list coll should be used within the template, and 'foo' should be the title of the html page.
