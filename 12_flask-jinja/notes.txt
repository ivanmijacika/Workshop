k12 -- Templates! 
2021-10-7

Summary: We first individually pulled notes-and-code and then quickly skimmed over the contents of the new assignment. 
We discussed the questions within app.py and answered them in notes.txt. We mostly focused on the sy ntax in the html
file and the structure of the template.

Q0: If you remove render_template I think it will no longer be able to use templates, such as the model_tmplt in the templates folder.

Q1: We can use the address from before "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" but with "my_foist_template" added on to the end

Q2:'model_tmplt.html' is the template being used, 'collection=coll' determines that the list coll should be used within the template, and 'foo' should be the title of the html page.

- We expected the output to be different when "my_foist_template" was added at the end of the url, and it was. A 
sequence of numbers was printed out as opposed to the usual "No hablo queso!"

Questions: How many different routes can you create from one file, and what's a good way to use that feature?
