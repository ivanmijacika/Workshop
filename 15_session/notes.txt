K15 -- Sessions Greetings
2021-10-20

- We had to make choices between varrying options, especially in relation to the error page and where to place the conditionals
- Using sessions was confusing at first, and we spent a large portion of our time learning how to use them and what errors they could produce.
- We were initially missing a secret key, causing some problems.
