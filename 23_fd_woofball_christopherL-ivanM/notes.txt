DISCO
Foundation seems much harder to use, as it does not seem to have containers or
padding or other default layout features. Dynamic features don't work without
JavaScript.

Q0
Yes: we consulted Team FTC > FRC to better understand layout features and to
get dynamic features to work with the provided JavaScript libraries.
