To create multiple columns, one method is to wrap each column in a div, wrap
all of the column divs in another div, and to add the `float` property to each
column. You can then set a column width as a percentage of the size of page
width or a set number of pixels. The important thing is that the element
after the column must have the `clear: both` property.
