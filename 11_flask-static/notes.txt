k11 -- Flask Staticness -- Exploration of Flask framework -- We explored static webpages
2021-10-6

Summary:
We explored the static site examples through flask. We had a folder called static, which we accessed by traveling through /static being tagged
on to the url. We messed around with some html, exploring the premade static materials and creating our own static site displaying our roster. 
We added some extra features to make our page a bit more interesting, helping us refresh some more on html in the process.


Notes/Observations:

- app.py looks similar to the ones from before
- because the __name__ is __main__, it should still print out "No hablo queso!"
- debugger will be turned on

- there's a 'static' file with foo and foo.html
	- foo doesn't have an end, so it is presented and treated as a plain text file
- foo.html should say the stated text

Questions: What is the full purpose of a static page? It still isn't completely clear to me.
