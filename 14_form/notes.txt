K14 -- Form and Function
2021-10-14

Predictions for uncommenting lines:
Should work as normal, and return the username submitted.

Results for uncommenting lines:
The first function throws an error when the line print(request.args['username']) are uncommented because the first function is
generating the webpage and therefore has not recieved a submission from the form. Due to this, the
args dictionary is empty, and args['username'] cannot be called. Second function returns the username
inputted.
