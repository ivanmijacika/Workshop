Q0: They syntax here is similar to java syntax when creating a new instance of a class.

Q1: Well route makes it seem as if it is directing where something goes. Maybe it has to do with directories, and "/" can lead to the root directory.

Q2: It will print wherever "/" lead it to, so maybe in the current directory in the terminal.
	- __main__, which I'm assuming is __name__, was printed out in the terminal area, seperate from "No hablo queso!"

Q3: No, "No hablo queso!" is returned but because the function itself is never printed that will not show anywhere through python.
	- It showed up on the browser

Q4: Again, it is simila to Java and it looks like running a function from within a class. 

===============
Discoveries: 
	- "No hablo questo!" actually did show up!
	- $python3 app.py didn't do anything initially and it was pretty confusing. It require extra steps and the involvement of a browser to be able to see any output.
